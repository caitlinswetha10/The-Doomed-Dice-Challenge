We want to find the probability of each possible sum (2 to 12) occurring when we roll two dice. To do this, we'll:
 * Determine the total number of possible outcomes (which we know is 36).
 * Count how many combinations of dice rolls result in each sum.
 * Calculate the probability for each sum by dividing the number of combinations by the total number of outcomes.
Calculations
 * Sum 2: (1, 1) - 1 combination. Probability = 1/36 ≈ 0.0278
 * Sum 3: (1, 2), (2, 1) - 2 combinations. Probability = 2/36 = 1/18 ≈ 0.0556
 * Sum 4: (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1) - 3 combinations. Probability = 3/36 = 1/12 ≈ 0.0833
 * Sum 5: (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1) - 4 combinations. Probability = 4/36 = 1/9 ≈ 0.1111
 * Sum 6: (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2), (5, 1) - 5 combinations. Probability = 5/36 ≈ 0.1389
 * Sum 7: (1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 2), (6, 1) - 6 combinations. Probability = 6/36 = 1/6 ≈ 0.1667
 * Sum 8: (2, 6), (3, 5), (4, 4), (5, 3), (6, 2) - 5 combinations. Probability = 5/36 ≈ 0.1389
 * Sum 9: (3, 6), (4, 5), (5, 4), (6, 3) - 4 combinations. Probability = 4/36 = 1/9 ≈ 0.1111
 * Sum 10: (4, 6), (5, 5), (6, 4) - 3 combinations. Probability = 3/36 = 1/12 ≈ 0.0833
 * Sum 11: (5, 6), (6, 5) - 2 combinations. Probability = 2/36 = 1/18 ≈ 0.0556
 * Sum 12: (6, 6) - 1 combination. Probability = 1/36 ≈ 0.0278
Probability Distribution
Here's the probability distribution of the sums:
 * P(Sum = 2) ≈ 0.0278
 * P(Sum = 3) ≈ 0.0556
 * P(Sum = 4) ≈ 0.0833
 * P(Sum = 5) ≈ 0.1111
 * P(Sum = 6) ≈ 0.1389
 * P(Sum = 7) ≈ 0.1667
 * P(Sum = 8) ≈ 0.1389
 * P(Sum = 9) ≈ 0.1111
 * P(Sum = 10) ≈ 0.0833
 * P(Sum = 11) ≈ 0.0556
 * P(Sum = 12) ≈ 0.0278
